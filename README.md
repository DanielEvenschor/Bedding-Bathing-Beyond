Micro-Segmentation and Persona Building for BBY's Customer Base
This project was an in-depth exploratory analysis of the customer base for Bedding Bathing & Yonder (BBY), a prominent American chain of domestic merchandise retail stores. The goal was to create detailed micro-segments and personas for BBY's loyalty program. The insights gained from this analysis would help the company target its marketing efforts more effectively and efficiently.

Data
The data used for this project was synthetically generated and had been randomized and anonymized to ensure privacy. It was comprised of multiple datasets representing various aspects of BBY's customer base, including purchasing habits, donation history, magazine subscription history, and political leanings. All datasets had a unique identifier, "tmpID", which could be used to join them. The enriched dataset had 80 variables, though not all were deemed useful or ethical for insights, exploratory data analysis (EDA), or persona building.

Methodology
The first step in the process was to clean the data by handling missing values and outliers. Next, the datasets were enriched by joining them on the "tmpID" field. This created a comprehensive view of each customer across the different data sources.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was then conducted on the enriched data to identify interesting patterns and relationships. This involved generating statistics and visualizations for each variable and examining correlations between variables.

From these analyses, several insights emerged, which were used to create detailed customer personas. These personas represented distinct segments of BBY's customer base, each with its own unique characteristics and behaviors.

Project Outcome
The project resulted in the identification of several distinct customer personas, which provided valuable insights into BBY's customer base. These personas can be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
